Julia Sets

    Written in Python 2.7.9
    using pygame 1.9.2b1

To install pygame: from the command prompt or Terminal, run the following:

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install pygame




This app mimics a Mandelbrot Set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

As well as cycling through Julia Sets: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set

It was inspired by a YouTuber (Daniel Shiffman): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAsaSkmbF5s

He programs in p5.js (JavaScript) and processing (Java).

I followed along with the video translating everything to Python, using pygame.
